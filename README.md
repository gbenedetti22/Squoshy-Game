# Squoshy - A Super Mario style game â€Ž <img style="transform: rotate(90deg)" height="50" src=".\assets\player\player.png" width="50"/>
This project was made for the course of [Progettazione Web](https://esami.unipi.it/esami2/programma.php?c=33853) during my university career in Pisa.<br>
For the creation, I was inspired by the classic 90's Super Mario game but with some addition of 
particular enemies capable of moving independently, flying or shooting. <br>

The score is incremeted when Squoshy takes coins or kills an enemy and, at the ned of the game, 
there will be a scoreboard where are shown the ten most player with the highest score.
Furthermore, there are various checkpoints that the player can take and these are saved on a database,
using PHP, in order to resume where they left off in case the player wants to disconnect. <br><br>
As levels are passed, Squoshy will unlock powers that will help him better face the path to the victory.

<br>
As said there will be multiple enemies that will try to kill you, and only some can be killed, 
so keep calm and use your super powers when needed!
